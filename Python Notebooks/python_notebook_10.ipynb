    "# 17.Abstraction and Encapsulation in Python\n",
    "Data abstraction and encapsulation are synonymous as data abstraction is achieved through encapsulation. Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities. Abstracting something means to give names to things, so that the name captures the basic idea of what a function or a whole program does. Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables. In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident."

    "## Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. In Python, abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract classes:**<br> These are classes that cannot be instantiated and typically contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods without implementations. Abstract classes are meant to be subclassed, and their abstract methods must be implemented by the subclasses.\n",
